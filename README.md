# Company-Workforce-Compensation-Dashboard
As a data analyst at a global tech solutions company, I presented our leadership with a dynamic dashboard summarizing our 30-member workforce from six countries, which revealed several surprising trends. The average employee salary stood at $96,711, with our total salary cost reaching $2,901,335, and team members bringing an average of 8.13 yearsâ€™ experience to the table. Berlin emerged as the city with the highest total compensation outlay, while Operations boasted the most seasoned employees, averaging 13 years of experience; this helped guide strategic decisions on hiring and resource allocation to maintain our competitive global edge.
